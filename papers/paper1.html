            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                A fundamental flaw in the way media recommendation systems currently operate lies at the heart of why digital experiences often leave us dissatisfied and sometimes unwell. A new approach to indexing and discovering content is the solution.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="paper-content">
            <p>
                It's well established that self determination, sometimes called freewill depending on the context, is contingent not just on having the freedom of choice, but also on the freedom of one's desires. If our desires are not aligned with our choices, or if some external force constrains our desires, then the freedom to act alone may not be sufficient for our freedom of choice. This insight about how our desires relate to our freedom is relevant today for the lives we inhabit inside media recommendation systems, because these systems often ignore our deepest desires.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our digital lives are immersed in recommender systems. Most of them work by modeling user choices and using the model to predict how content will cause us to act. For instance, on many platforms the recommendations are selected based on what the model predicts will keep us on the platform the longest.
            </p>

            <p>
                To build these models of users, existing platforms rely almost entirely on the implicit actions we take, like clicks and watch time, rather than explicit inputs, like a user-reported preference or feeling. This is a problem as our emotions are obviously fundamental to the development of our desires and the execution of our choices. But if systems do not provide a means of easily reflecting our feelings and our desires in our choices then our actual desires and our explicit actions may start to diverge. For example, we might find that despite spending considerable time on a platform we also quite dislike it.
            </p>

            <p>
                This disconnection between our choices and desires is possible because behavior doesn't mirror desires in a perfect one-to-one way. Choices are more like an ocean current, the net result of competing and conflicting desires that are in a constant state of experiment and change. It's been said that we have desires about desires, which reflect our changing personal identities and goals. We act, get feedback from the world, weigh our competing desires, change our feelings and attitudes, and act again. And it's in the continuous unfolding of this process that our freedom of choice emerges.
            </p>

            <p>
                But current recommendation systems don't consider our internal mental states in modeling our experience, so as we engage the current platforms we're training the models on a limited version of ourselves. These models are then used to narrow the range of our future recommendations, which increases the probability that you'll click on more of what you did earlier, simply because there's less variety. And when you do click on more of the same, that in turn, strengthens the previous model again, and your future recommendations become even more narrow, and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a feedback loop in which our initial choices become unnaturally magnified focal points of interest over time. So the probability that a fleeting interest will become an entrenched habit in the future can increase in a very unnatural way. This kind of choice recursion is new in communications technology due to the degree of personal immersion and immediacy of recommendation adjustment that digital experiences enable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Failing to appreciate this relationship between our deepest thoughts and desires and content recommendation design is part of why social media, while fun at times, makes some people miserable and many of us dissatisfied, and yet we don't reduce its usage. There are many contexts where recommender systems are less concerning, such as in the curation of specific media, like music or movie recommendations. But our online environments are becoming more than just entertainment delivery systems and are increasingly immersive proxies for the real world. As more of our analog lives move online, these concerns become more significant.
            </p>

            <p>
                The solution lies in creating digital experiences that better reflect our deepest desires. This means adapting recommendation systems to better appreciate user outcomes, satisfaction, and overall psychological experience. This could be enabled by creating a new layer of content tagging and connecting the moods, goals, and other more meaningful internal experiences of users with the content. Third, we must design low-friction interfaces that let users easily report on their deepest ever-changing desires and filter content based on the moods, desires, and outcomes they want.
            </p>

            <p>
                Algorithms may determine digital design but they should enable our deepest desires to determine our digital experience.
